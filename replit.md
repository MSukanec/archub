# Archub - Construction Management Platform

## Overview

Archub is a modern construction management platform built with a React frontend and Express.js backend. The application provides tools for tracking projects, managing teams, and monitoring budgets in the construction industry. It features a responsive design with authentication, dashboard analytics, and a comprehensive UI component library.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (auth, navigation, theme)
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx and Vite middleware integration

### Authentication Strategy
- **Primary**: Supabase Auth for user management
- **Providers**: Email/password and Google OAuth
- **Session Handling**: Supabase sessions with persistent storage
- **State Management**: Zustand store with authentication state

## Key Components

### Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: Shared between frontend and backend (`shared/schema.ts`)
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory fallback

### UI Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui with "new-york" style variant
- **Theme**: Neutral color palette with dark mode support
- **Components**: Comprehensive set including forms, data display, navigation
- **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI for ARIA compliance

### State Management
- **Authentication**: User session, loading states, sign-in/out methods
- **Navigation**: Sidebar state, current page tracking, menu items
- **Theme**: Dark/light mode with persistence

### Development Tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite with runtime error overlay
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Code Quality**: ESLint integration (implicit)
- **Path Aliases**: Absolute imports for components and utilities

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User authenticates via Supabase Auth
   - Session stored in Zustand with persistence
   - Protected routes redirect to auth modal if unauthenticated
   - Auth state initialized on app load

2. **API Communication**:
   - Frontend uses React Query for server state
   - Custom query client with authentication handling
   - Express backend provides REST API endpoints
   - Shared types between frontend and backend

3. **Database Operations**:
   - Drizzle ORM handles database queries
   - Storage interface abstracts database operations
   - In-memory storage for development/testing
   - PostgreSQL for production data persistence

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Supabase**: Authentication and potentially additional services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Radix UI**: Headless component primitives
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management
- **Drizzle**: Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **esbuild**: Production build bundling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

### UI Libraries
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **clsx + tailwind-merge**: Conditional class merging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles Node.js server to `dist/index.js`
- **Development**: Concurrent frontend/backend with hot reload
- **Production**: Static frontend serving with Express API

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Supabase**: API URL and anonymous key for authentication
- **Replit**: Configured for autoscale deployment target
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, external port 80

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Database Management**: `npm run db:push` syncs schema changes
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript
- **Build**: `npm run build` creates production assets
